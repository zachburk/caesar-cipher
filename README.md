# caesar-cipher

This Caesar cipher was programmed using the tkinter library to create a GUI so the user can enter a message to encrypt as well as the shift value and it will return the new encrypted message. The user can also enter ciphertext and the shift value to decrypt it back to the original message. 

I decided to create this project because I took a cryptography class that had no programming assignments. I wanted to create something with a GUI as well and I thought this would be the most appropriate project to do so.
